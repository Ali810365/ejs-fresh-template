                                Sheeran was in a relationship with Scottish singer-songwriter Nina Nesbitt (who was in
                                his music video for "Drunk") in 2012, before breaking up. Nesbitt is the subject of
                                Sheeran's songs "Nina" and "Photograph", while most of Nesbitt's album, Peroxide, is
                                about Sheeran. In 2014, Sheeran was in a relationship with Athina Andrelos, who
                                works for chef Jamie Oliver. She is the inspiration of Sheeran's song "Thinking Out
                                Loud". They broke up in February 2015.

                                Ed Sheeran's musical style has been described as pop,
                                folk-pop, and soft rock. Sheeran also incorporates rap into his
                                music. Sheeran's earliest memories include listening to the records of Joni
                                Mitchell, Bob Dylan and Elton John's Greatest Hits. According to Sheeran, the album
                                that introduced him to music was Van Morrison's Irish Heartbeat. During his
                                childhood his father took him to live concerts that would inspire his musical creations.

                                Sheeran is also a fan of heavier music and cites bands such as Cradle of Filth,
                                Slipknot, Korn, Marilyn Manson and Bring Me the Horizon as other influences.
                                As a teenager, he also had a Kerrang! subscription. According to Sheeran, he had a
                                stutter in his speech when he was younger, and he credited rapping along to Eminem's The
                                Marshall Mathers LP for helping him stammer less.
                                He was also inspired by "Cannonball" singer-songwriter Damien Rice in 2002, with Sheeran
                                stating, "seeing him play this small club in Ireland, I was able to meet him, and he was
                                unbelievably cool.
